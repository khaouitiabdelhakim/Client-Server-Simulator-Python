# Client-Server Simulation on localhost

This Python project demonstrates a simple client-server interaction on localhost. The server listens for client connections and responds with information about various web browsers based on user input.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

## Running the Server

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the server script:

   ```
   python server.py
   ```

## Running the Client

1. Open a new terminal window.

2. Run the client script:

   ```
   python client.py
   ```

3. Enter a browser name when prompted.

## Usage

- Enter a browser name (e.g., "Google Chrome", "Mozilla Firefox", "Microsoft Edge").
- The server responds with information about the entered browser.
- Terminate the client with Ctrl+C.

## Customization

- Modify browser names and definitions in `server.py`.
- Implement error handling and multi-threading for advanced features.
